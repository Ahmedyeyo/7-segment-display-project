# 7-segment-display-project
This project implements a 7-segment display controller using VHDL on a DE10-Lite FPGA board. The design decodes binary inputs to display numbers 0-3 and shows the letter 'E' for inputs 4-7. The project is archived in a .qar file for easy restoration in Quartus.




Project Description

Features
Displays digits 0, 1, 2, 3 for binary inputs 000, 001, 010, 011.
Displays 'E' for binary inputs 100, 101, 110, 111.
Implemented in VHDL and tested on a DE10-Lite FPGA board.
Requirements
Quartus Prime software for working with the project files.
DE10-Lite FPGA Board for hardware testing and programming.
How to Use the Project
Download and extract the 7_segment_display.qar file from this repository.
Open Quartus Prime.
Go to File > Restore Archive and select the 7_segment_display.qar file to restore the project.
Compile the project in Quartus and program the DE10-Lite board to see the 7-segment display functionality.
